## Depth Estimation Using Image Pre-Processing
# Project Overview
This project improves monocular depth estimation performance by applying image pre-processing techniques like exposure correction and edge enhancement before feeding the images into deep learning models.
We integrate:

LCDPNet for exposure correction

SG-WLS filtering for edge enhancement (manually via MATLAB)

Marigold and Depth Anything V2 models for depth estimation

Standard evaluation metrics for performance comparison.

# Key Features
Automatic download and extraction of NYU-Depth V2 dataset.

Image pre-processing using LCDPNet.

Edge enhancement using SG-WLS manually via MATLAB.

Depth map prediction using Marigold and Depth Anything V2.

Evaluation based on RMSE, MAE, AbsRel, and SSIM.

Fully automated Python pipeline for all steps (except MATLAB).

# Summary
This project shows that applying targeted image pre-processing significantly improves the accuracy of monocular depth estimation models.
It highlights how even simple preprocessing steps like exposure correction and edge enhancement can lead to measurable gains without modifying the model architecture.

# Important Notes

MATLAB Required: You need MATLAB installed for SG-WLS filtering.

Weights Download: Ensure you download the pre-trained weights for Marigold and Depth Anything V2 if needed.

Manual Step: Manual SG-WLS filtering is required between Steps 2 and 4.
